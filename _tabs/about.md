Hello everyone!

I’m a student at **OFPPT**, currently learning and building my foundations in cybersecurity.

I’m still a beginner, exploring different areas of IT and security step by step.  
Right now, I’m especially interested in:
- Windows and Active Directory  
- Web security and web pentesting basics  
- Understanding how systems work under the hood  

In my free time, I practice on platforms like **Hack The Box** and **pentesterlab**, mostly doing labs and beginner challenges.

This blog is simply a place where I share:
- My writeps
- My notes
- What I learn while practicing and experimenting  

I’m not an expert — I’m learning in public, making mistakes, and improving over time.  
If you’re also starting out, you might find something useful here.
